# Google Translate Clone üìù
**<p>In this project, I created a Google Translate Clone with the help of React and Redux Thunk. Asynchronous operations were managed more effectively with Redux Thunk. You can instantly translate words from any language into the target language.</p>**

## What is Redux Thunk ? 
**<p>Redux Thunk is used to manage asynchronous operations in Redux. It is especially useful for operations such as network requests. Thunk allows you to manage asynchronous operations using action creators. This allows you to add asynchronous operations to Redux's ability to handle synchronous operations alone. This makes your application more efficient and flexible.</p>**
